This is a toy example of what a backoff parser might look like.

Because Intellij apparently uses the unshaded module instead of the shaded jar,
I couldn't add this in the maven dependency to a module in the same project:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.tallison</groupId>
      <artifactId>pdfbox18-shaded</artifactId>
      <version>1.13-SNAPSHOT</version>
      <type>jar</type>
    </dependency>

I followed the workaround described (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15731713/maven-shade-relocations-accross-all-modules)
and manually added the shaded jar to the project.

This is a bad idea.  Any recommendations are welcomed!

I also tried this as a separate project, and pulled from my local repo, and all worked.
